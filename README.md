My C Language Learning Journey

Introduction

This repository contains my progressive learning in C language. My purpose is to share my advances and experiments while learning it. Note that all code in this repository is written and compiled by me. The programs aren't designed to showcase complex or perfectly optimized code, but rather to document an honest exploration and playful journey experimenting with the language for the first time.

Motivation

I first encountered C language through the desire to enrich my graphic design position. To upgrade my skills, I started researching programming development, focusing on a language that would teach me not just about software development but also about how machines work at a lower level, and that would serve as a foundation for learning other languages more easily.
To my surprise, I found that C fulfilled these exact requirements. As if that wasn't enough, I also discovered that C has direct impact on OpenGL and shading languages - subjects I also want to explore as a graphic designer.

Repository Structure

This repository is organized chronologically by month:

march2025/ - Contains all C exercises and projects created in March 2025
Future months will be added as my learning journey continues (e.g., april2025/, may2025/)


About the Code
My own programs in this repository may not be highly elaborate or optimized, but they represent my first appearance as a programmer - something that brings me a lot of joy!
Enjoy exploring the code, and perhaps try it yourself ;)
